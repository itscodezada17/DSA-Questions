lets assume if 0 is the largest element -1 will be 2nd largest.
While traversing in the array we yhave to keep records of largest and 2nd largest element.

Assign values to the largest and 2nd largest on the basis of 
          if   a[i] > a[largest]  then 2ndLargest = largest and largest = i .
          else if a[i] < a[largest]  then 
                      if res = -1 then res= i .
                      else if a[i] > a[res] then res = i.
                      
                      any other cases will be ignored.
